In this exercise, you will create a python program for a pet adoption center that can read data about various adoptable animals from CSV files, based on user input. In the included sample data, there are already two CSV files, containing information about cats and dogs. 


## Requirements

- Write a program that lets a user input a type of animal at the command line, and then displays information about those animals from the appropriate CSV file.
